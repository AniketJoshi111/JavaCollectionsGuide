# Java Collections and Map Examples

This project demonstrates the usage of Java's `List`, `Set`, and `Map` interfaces along with some commonly used classes such as `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap`, and `TreeMap`. Each file includes basic operations for these data structures, along with real-world examples.

## Files in this Project

### 1. **ArrayListExample.java**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates the usage of `ArrayList`, including adding elements, iterating, checking for existence, sorting, and removing elements.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Adding, removing, and accessing elements
     - Sorting, searching, and iterating
     - Working with sublists and checking existence of an element
     -Stream API 
   - **Link**: [ArrayListExample.java](./lists/ArrayListExample.java)

### 2. **LinkedListExample.java**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates how to use `LinkedList`, with operations such as adding/removing elements, checking if an element exists, and iterating over the list.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Accessing first and last elements
     - Adding/removing at the beginning and end
     - Checking the list size and iterating over elements
   - **Link**: [LinkedListExample.java](./lists/LinkedListExample.java)

### 3. **HashSetExample.java**
   - **Description**: Shows the basic operations of a `HashSet`, including adding/removing elements, checking for existence, and iterating over the set.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Adding, removing, and checking if an element exists
     - Checking if the set is empty
     - Iterating over all elements
   - **Link**: [HashSetExample.java](./sets/HashSetExample.java)

### 4. **TreeSetExample.java**
   - **Description**: Similar to `HashSet`, but the elements are sorted. This file demonstrates operations on a `TreeSet`, including adding/removing elements, and checking if an element exists.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Sorted order of elements
     - Adding, removing, and checking existence of an element
     - Iterating over sorted elements
   - **Link**: [TreeSetExample.java](./sets/TreeSetExample.java)

### 5. **SetOperations.java**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates set operations such as union, intersection, and difference between two sets.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Union, intersection, and difference of two sets
     - Symmetric difference
     - Checking if one set contains all elements of another set
   - **Link**: [SetOperations.java](./sets/SetOperations.java)

### 6. **HashMapExample.java**
   - **Description**: Provides basic operations for a `HashMap`, including adding, updating, removing elements, checking for existence, and iterating over the map entries.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Adding, removing, and accessing key-value pairs
     - Checking if a key or value exists
     - Iterating over the map entries
   - **Link**: [HashMapExample.java](./maps/HashMapExample.java)

### 7. **TreeMapExample.java**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates the usage of `TreeMap`, which sorts elements by key. It covers operations such as adding, updating, removing, and checking existence of elements.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Sorted order of entries by key
     - Adding, removing, and accessing key-value pairs
     - Iterating over the sorted map entries
   - **Link**: [TreeMapExample.java](./maps/TreeMapExample.java)

### 8. **WordFrequencyCounter.java**
   - **Description**: This program counts the frequency of words in a given string and uses a `HashMap` to store and display the word counts.
   - **Operations covered**:
     - Counting word frequency
     - Iterating over the `Map` entries to display word counts
     - Removing and clearing entries
   - **Link**: [WordFrequencyCounter.java](./maps/WordFrequencyCounter.java)
